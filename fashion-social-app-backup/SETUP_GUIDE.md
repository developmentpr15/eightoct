```

## 🚀 Next Steps to Run the App

### 1. **Setup Supabase Database**
```sql
-- Run the supabase-schema.sql file in your Supabase SQL editor
-- This will create all tables, functions, and default data
```

### 2. **Environment Configuration**
The `.env` file is already configured with your API keys:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://elquosmpqghmehnycytw.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=7eba163fb75499e23a45563e0c0b05e6
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd /home/z/my-project/fashion-social-app
npm install
